Sign Language Detection and Recommendation System

Overview

The Sign Language Detection and Recommendation System was developed to bridge the communication gap for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. This innovative application utilizes computer vision and machine learning to interpret sign language gestures and convert them into text or speech. Additionally, it provides contextual recommendations for appropriate responses, ensuring more inclusive and effective communication.

Key Features

Real-time Gesture Recognition: Detects and translates sign language gestures into text or speech in real-time.

Contextual Recommendations: Offers appropriate response suggestions based on interpreted gestures.

User-Friendly Interface: Features a simple and intuitive interface for seamless interaction.

Multilingual Support: Recognizes gestures from multiple sign languages (e.g., ASL, BSL).

Customizable Models: Extendable to include additional gestures and languages as needed.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Frameworks:

OpenCV (image processing)

TensorFlow/Keras (deep learning models)

TextBlob (natural language processing)

Hardware: Compatible with any camera-enabled device

How It Works

Gesture Input: Captures hand gestures using a camera.

Gesture Recognition: Processes the input via pre-trained models to identify the gesture.

Translation: Converts the recognized gesture into text or speech.

Recommendation: Provides suggested responses based on context to enhance communication.
