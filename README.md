##Sign Language Detection and Recommendation System

#Overview

- I developed this Sign Language Detection and Recommendation System to bridge the communication gap for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.

- This innovative application uses computer vision and machine learning to interpret sign language gestures and convert them into text or speech.

- It also provides contextual recommendations for appropriate responses.

- The aim is to make communication more inclusive and effective.

#Key Features

- Real-time Gesture Recognition: Detects and translates sign language gestures into text or speech in real-time.

- Contextual Recommendations: Suggests appropriate responses based on the interpreted gestures.

- User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for seamless interaction.

- Multilingual Support: Recognizes gestures in multiple sign languages (e.g., ASL, BSL).

- Customizable Models: Extendable for adding new gestures and languages.

#Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python

- Libraries & Frameworks:

OpenCV (for image processing)

TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models)

TextBlob (for natural language processing)

Hardware: Any camera-enabled device

#How It Works

- Gesture Input: The system captures hand gestures using a camera.

- Gesture Recognition: Processes the input using pre-trained models to identify the gesture.

- Translation: Converts the recognized gesture into corresponding text or speech.

- Recommendation: Analyzes context and provides suggested responses to improve communication.
